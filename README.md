So Happy Together

An experimental project based in community.
Inspired by the differences between experiences had together versus apart, So Happy Together is an exploration in how being "together" feels. In this piece, the viewer can create "birds" of many colors on the canvas, but these "birds" only animate once there are multiple viewers. The flocks may only come together if its audience does too.
